= Introduction =

Inception is the phase where we analyze whether or not it is worth to build our system.


= Overview =

We need to take a look at:
  * Actors and Use-Cases
  * Detail the important use-cases
  * Brief description of the other use-cases
Artifacts:
  * Use-Case Model
  * Supplementary Specification
  * Glossary
  * Risk List + Management Plan
  * Prototypes
  * Iteration Plan
  * Phase Plan + Software Development Plan
  * Development Case 

= Actors and Use-Cases =
== Actors ==
  * User
