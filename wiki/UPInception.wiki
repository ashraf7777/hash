#summary First Phase of the Project
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Inception is the phase where we analyze whether or not it is worth to build our system.


= Overview =

We need to take a look at:
  * Actors and Use-Cases
  * Detail the important use-cases
  * Brief description of the other use-cases
Artifacts:
  * Use-Case Model
  * Supplementary Specification
  * Glossary
  * Risk List + Management Plan
  * Prototypes
  * Iteration Plan
  * Phase Plan + Software Development Plan
  * Development Case 

= Actors and Use-Cases =
== Actors ==
  * User
  * Super User
  * Time
== Use-Cases ==
  # Manage Things (General CRUD Use-Case)
    * Manage Users
    * Manage Housing
    * Manage Inhabitants
    * Manage Community
    * Manage Facilities
    * Manage Communication
    * ...
  # Log in
  # Establish Rent
  # Terminate Rent
  # Back-up Data
  # Restore Data


= Brief Use-Cases =

== UC1 - Manage Things ==
Main Success Scenario:
  # User requests system to add, update or remove a thing
  # System asks for confirmation
  # System applies the changes

== UC2 - Log in ==
Main Success Scenario:
  # User types in his credentials
  # System grants access


== UC3 - Establish Rent ==
Main Success Scenario:
  # User Assigns a Propriety to one or more inhabitants
  # System asks for permission and review of data
  # System applies changes

== UC4 - Terminate Rent ==
Main Success Scenario:
  # User remove a propriety from one or more inhabitants
  # System asks for permission and review of data
  # System applies changes

== UC5 - Backup Data==
  User asks system to make a data backup, system asks for permission, system makes a backup on external medium.

== UC6 - Restore Data==
  User asks system to make a data restore, system asks for permission, system checks and integrate the backed-up data with the existing data.
