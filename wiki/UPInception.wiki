= Introduction =

Inception is the phase where we analyze whether or not it is worth to build our system.


= Overview =

We need to take a look at:
  * Actors and Use-Cases
  * Detail the important use-cases
  * Brief description of the other use-cases

= Actors and Use-Cases =
== Actors ==
  * User
  * Super User
== Use-Cases ==
  * Manage Users
  * Log in
  * Manage Housing
  * Manage Inhabitants
  * Manage Community
  * Manage Facilities
  * Establish Rent
  * Terminate Rent
  * Manage Communication
  * Back-up and Restore Data
